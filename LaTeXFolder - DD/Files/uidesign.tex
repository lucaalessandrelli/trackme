\noindent
in this Section the user interface design, already presented in  \textit{Section 3.1.1 User Interfaces} of \textit{Requirements and Analysis Specification Document} with several mockups, is explained in more detail. A special attention is focused on the interaction between the user and the systems, how the mockups are connected each other.

TrackMe offers to AutomatedSOS users an App for smartwatches, with which the users can see their location and health status information.

\end{figure}
In the first access to AutomatedSOS App the user is asked to sign up or to sign in 			(Figure 2). Based on the fact that the user already has a TrackMe account or not will choose the right option. In future accesses to the App the user do not need to select each time one of these two possible options because the App automatically remembers the account which is logged in. In case of sign in (Figure 3), the user has to fill all the mandatory fields in order to complete the registration form. Scrolling down the screen other fields will appear. Once every field is correctly filled, it would be possible to select the \textbf{NEXT PAGE} button.

\end{figure}
During the first access to the App, the next step after sign up/sign in is to agree to the Privacy Policy Conditions (Figure 4). In order to use this App the user has to agree to the treatment of Location and Health Status data by Data4Help. In addition, these data could be used by third parties for the group monitoring request. Without agreeing the Privacy Policy Conditions the user cannot go to the next page, therefore he/she will not be able to use this App. The last step before starting use the App is taking note of the importance of wearing the Smartwatch as much as possible and to let the App runs in background (Figure 5).

\end{figure}
The main menu of the App, which is immediately accessible by selecting the AutomatedSOS App on the Smartwatch home, is composed by three parts (Figure 6). Selecting \textbf{Monitor Health} the user can see live health informations, like the current Heart Rate, Blood Pressure and so on. Choosing the \textbf{Acquired Info} button the user can see all the historical data stored since the first access to the App. Finally, \textbf{Preferences} option allow to the user to set own threshold parameters according to the particular illnesses he/she is affected, own age and so on. As soon as an ambulance request is done due to the user's critical health status a warning message (Figure 7) appears on the screen of the Smartwatch notified by an alert sound.

\item[•]{\Large Track4Run}

\noindent
Track4Run users can use an App for smartphone and another one for smartwatches. The first one could be used by everyone, while the second one is made only for the athletes.

In order to use this App the user has to agree to the treatment of Location and Health Status data by Data4Help. In addition, these data could be used by third parties for the group monitoring request. Without agreeing the Privacy Policy Conditions the user can not go to the next page, therefore he/she will not be able to use this App. All the three first steps presented so far are substantially the same of AutomatedSOS. The next step regards the second part of the Privacy Policy Conditions (which was not presented for the previous system) about individual monitoring request (Figure 9).  In this case it is not strictly necessary to accept it, the user simply can select the \textbf{No, thanks} option.

\end{figure}
In Track4Run Home three options are possible. Selecting the first one, \textbf{Promote a Run}, a user can create a run event and promote it inviting athletes. The second option, which is \textbf{Enroll to a run} allows the user enrol to a run. Finally, choosing \textbf{Spectate a Run} a spectator can see on a map the position of all runners during the run. Now, we analyze these three possibilities in detail. Choosing the first one the App leads the user to a new page in order to manage the event (Figure X). Here, it is possible to set all the necessary features of the run, like to define the path on a map, set the date, the starting time and so on. It is also possible to invite athletes to the run in order to promote the event.

\end{figure}
In the section Enroll to a Run (Figure X) a user can see a list of all the runs in which he/she has been invited. The user can select each of these runs to see furthermore details about it and at the end to enroll to it. A list of all the runs that will be soon held is showed immediately below. Since the large number of all the future runs, only a little portion of them is showed, selecting the \textbf{More +} button the user can see another set of run events. In addition, through \textbf{Add filters} it is possible to limit the list of the all runs to a spefic date, location and similar options. To easily access to a specific run, the \textbf{Search} button allows the user to immediately find the run he/she was looking for. In the last section, Spectate a Run (Figure X), it is possible to spectate to a specific run in a interactive way. A map shows all the runners enrolled in it, each one represented by a different coloured circle. Selecting the \textbf{+} button is possible to zoom in the map that will appear on full-screen mode. Below the map the live positioning show the first four athletes, anyway selecting \textbf{See all the Athletes} option it is possible to see the live positions of all the participants.
