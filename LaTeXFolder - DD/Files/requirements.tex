		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] UserLogger: Receive from SignAccount interface that user has accepted the first part of pivacy policy then, if decide finally to create an account pass all these information to WebInterface.
		\item[•] WebServer: Receive from WebInterface the credentials and provide them to credential manager through CredentialInterface.
		\item[•] CredentialManager: Check the credentials inserted and if they are valid store them into DB using DBInterface.
		\item[•] DBMS: Store data incoming from DBInterface.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item [R.4] During the registration allow individuals to specify if they are also interested to be tracked in single mode (agree the second part of privacy policy) through installed application.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] UserLogger: Receive from SignAccount interface that user has accepted the als the second part of pivacy policy then, if decide finally to create an account pass all these information to WebInterface.
		\item[•] WebServer: Receive from WebInterface the credentials and provide them to credential manager through CredentialInterface.
		\item[•] CredentialManager: Check the credentials inserted and if they are valid store them into DB using DBInterface.
		\item[•] DBMS: Store data incoming from DBInterface.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item [R.5] After the registration, the system provides the password to access the data through provided e-mail.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] SAREBBE MEGLIO TOGLIERLA. (casino)
		\end{enumerate}

	\item [R.2] Allow users already registered in Data4Help world to sign in with their account without providing user credentials again.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] UserLogger: Whenever a user start the application automaticcaly this component inform the WebServer.
		\item[•] WebServer: Receive from WebInterface users' log request and send those to CredentialManager.
		\item[•] CredentialManager: Check the users' availability and communicate it in reverse order allowing UserLogger to decide if user is admissible or not.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item [R.5] For each user registered the system has to automatically retrieve and store data from partner applications with a resolution of 10 minutes; independently from the requests reached.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] WebServer: Provide to third parties using WebInterface a web page that allows them to insert all the necessary credentials; then retrieve these informations. Moreover send these data to CredentialManager using CredentialInterface.
		\item[•] CredentialManager: Check the credentials inserted and if they are valid store them into DB using DBInterface.
		\item[•] DBMS: Store data incoming from DBInterface.
		\end{enumerate}	
	\end{enumerate}

\item [G.2] Provide to third parties, the user’s position and health status.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [R.6] Allow third parties to register to Data4Help service specifying all their credentials.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] WebServer: Provide to third parties using WebInterface a web page that allows them to insert all the necessary credentials; then retrieve these informations. Moreover send these data to CredentialManager using CredentialInterface.
		\item[•] CredentialManager: Check the credentials inserted and if they are valid store them into DB using DBInterface.
		\item[•] DBMS: Store data incoming from DBInterface.
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\item [R.7] The system should allow third parties to send information requests.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] WebServer: Provide to third parties using WebInterface a web page that allows them to make a request inserting all the necessary information. Then pass the request using AcceptInformationRequest interface.
		\item[•] RequestManager: Receive requests from AcceptInformationRequest interface and stack them in a queue sorted by urgence criteria.
		\end{enumerate}	
	\end{enumerate}

\item [G.2.1] Provide data on demand to non-subscribed third parties.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [R.8] The system has to collect all the useful data that match the request.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] RequestManager: This component periodically check the queue in order to select the more urgent request. Once an on-demand request is picked up it wraps the request and send it to DataCollector.
		\item[•] DataCollector: This component once a data request is received builds a DB query that match what third partie wants and send it to DB using DBInterface.
		\item[•] DBMS: This component when the query is arrived, compute it and provide data to the DataCollector using DBInterface.
		\end{enumerate}	
			
	\item [R.9] The system has to generate a statistic on data selected.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] DataCollector: This component once data are arrived from DB, asks through ProvideStatistic interface to compute some kind of statistic on the data.
		\item[•] StatisticGenerator: This component receive data from ProvideStatistic interface, compute statistics and send back them to DataCollector.
		\end{enumerate}	
		
	\item [R.10] The system has to send to the third party all the raw data collected until the moment of the request.
	\item [R.11] The system has to send all the statistics already produced.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] DataCollector: This component once data are arrived from DB and statistics are generated, wrap them and send this package to RequestCollector using ProvideCollectedData interface.
		\item[•] RequestCollector: This component receive information from DataCollector, unwrap and send them using ProvideInfromation interface to WebServer.
		\item[•] WebServer: Provide to third parties using WebInterface a web page that allows them to see statisitics and download retrieved information.
		\end{enumerate}	
	\end{enumerate}

\item [G.2.2] Provide data in real-time to subscribed third parties.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [R.12] Allow third parties to subscribe to groups or individuals in order to receive live data.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] RequestManager: Once a real-time request is acquired this component stores all the attributes selcted in order to make the subscription. Using a parallel thread automatically add into the priority queue data request to supply live acquisition.
		\item[•] DataCollector: This component once a data request is received builds a DB query in order to retreive only new data that match what third partie wants and send it to DB using DBInterface.
		\item[•] DBMS: This component when the query is arrived, compute it and provide data to the DataCollector using DBInterface.
		\end{enumerate}	
			
	\item [R.13] Provide to subscribed third parties raw data as soon as they are available by the system.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[•] DataCollector: This component once data are arrived from DB, wrap them and send this package to RequestCollector using ProvideCollectedData interface.
		\item[•] RequestCollector: This component receive information from DataCollector, unwrap and send them using ProvideInfromation interface to WebServer.
		\item[•] WebServer: Provide to third parties using WebInterface a web page that allows them to download retrieved information.
		\end{enumerate}	
	\end{enumerate}
	
\item [G.3] Allow third parties two different ways to get users’ data.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [R.14] Allow third parties to insert the fiscal code of the user he wants to track.
