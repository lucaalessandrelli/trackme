\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}
In the specification document certain parts were not specific and were ambiguous. So we decided to make the following assumptions.

\subsubsection{Text Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}

\item[•] {\Large Data4Help}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Users' information are collected from partner applications on users' devices.
	\item For example all the fitness application developed for smartwatch can be partner applications, also AutomatedSOS and Track4Run can be them as well.
	\item Only registered third parties can request monitoring service.
	\item Groups are characterized by its member’s attributes (age, gender, city, etc…).
	\item Discriminative attributes are all the credentials inserted by user (i.e. age, job etc...), their location more or less precise (country, region, city, neighbourhood ..) and the period of time interested (days, weeks, months..).
	\item Third parties in group mode are interested in number of users that match attribute specified, their location statistics and the statistics of group health status.
	\item Group mode acquisition can be performed without user's agreement.
	\item Third parties in single mode are interested to retrieve the sequence of position and health status information, detected from a certain users during a selected time period.	
	\item Single mode acquisition cannot be performed without user's agreement.
	\item Health status parameters acquirable are all the ones supported by a standard smartwatch as: Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Pedometer, Calories Calculation.
	\item Geographic location can be retrieved either by smartwatch or smartphone.
	\end{enumerate}
	
\item[•] {\Large AutomatedSOS}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item For this service individuals subscribe to a single Third Party and not the other way around.
    \item Third parties interested in this type of service are only non-profit organizations that want to rescue individuals in a faster way.
    \item Different third parties cannot receive information from the same user (Otherwise both send the same SOS request).
    \item This service can be used only by elderly people (70+) or by who really need it, to avoid useless waste of resources. 
	\end{enumerate}
	
\item[•] {\Large Track4Run}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Any user can organize an event.
    \item An event can be public or private.
    \item If the event is private then, the organizer need to know the security number or the fiscal code of the athletes to invite.
    \item If the event is public then the only restriction is in the number of athletes admitted.
    \item All the events can be followed by everyone as spectator.
    \item All users invited to an event can accept or discard the request.
    \item Race path are always composed by citizen routes (never in private circuits or stadiums)
