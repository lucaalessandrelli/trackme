\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[•]{\Large Data4Help}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [G.1] \textbf{Collect users' position and health status.}
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item [D.1] Users' information are collected from partner applications or from the other two TrackMe applications installed on users' devices.
		\item [D.2] All the partner applications require to submit user credentials.
		\item [D.3] The identification (fiscal code, social security number) and the secondary data (attributes) given by the individual during the registration are correct.
		\item [R.1] Retrieve user credentials inserted into partner application as group attributes.
		\item [R.2] Allow individuals to become registered users when policy is approved (first part). Registered users, now, can be tracked in group mode request.  
		\item [R.3] Allow individuals to specify, during registration, if they are also interested to be tracked in single mode request (second part).
		\item [D.4] Devices used to monitor individuals always work and report 			the correct values.	
    	\item [D.5] Partner application always report correct values to Data4Help.
    	\item [R.4] The system has to correctly receive data from partner applications installed on users' device.
    	\end{enumerate}	
    	
    \item [G.2] \textbf{Provide to Third Parties, the users' position and heath status.}
    	\begin{enumerate} 
    	\item [R.5] Allow third parties registration to Data4Help service, where they have to specify all their credentials.
    	\end{enumerate}	
		
		\begin{enumerate} 
		\item [G.2.1] \textbf{Provide data on-demand to non-subscribed third parties.}
		\begin{enumerate} 
		\item [R.6] For each user registered ,the system has to automatically retrieve and store data from partner applications with a resolution of 10 minutes.	
		\item [R.7] The system has to collect inside his database all the useful information that match the request.
		\item [R.8] The system has to send to applicant all the data already collected.
    	\end{enumerate}	
    	
    	\item [G.2.2] \textbf{Provide data in real-time to subscribed third parties.}
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item [D.8] Live acquisition lasts 24 hours to reduce waste of resources.
    	\item [R.9] Allow third parties subscription to interested group in order to receive live data.
    	\item [R.10] When a real time request is performed the system has to collect and store specific users' data with a resolution of 1 minute.
    	\item [R.11] Provide to subscribed third parties data as soon as they are available by the system.
    	\end{enumerate}
    	\end{enumerate}
    
	\item [G.3] \textbf{Allow third parties two different ways to get users' data.}
		\begin{enumerate}     
    	\item [G.3.1] \textbf{Allow third parties to get data of a single person.}
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item [D.6] In order to perform an individual request, third parties has to know the user's fiscal code or security number.
		\item [D.7] Security number and fiscal code are not information given to third parties by Data4Help.
    	\item [R.12] Allow third parties to insert fiscal code of user that want to track.
    	\item [R.13] Deny third parties to receive information about users that have not accepted second part of privacy policy.
    	\item [R.14] Collect all the useful information retrieved by Data4Help that are produced by the interested user and send them to request applicant.
    	\end{enumerate}
    
    	\item [G.3.2] \textbf{Allow third parties to get data of a group of people.}
		\begin{enumerate}
    	\item [R.15] Allow third parties to insert attributes in which they are interested to restrict their field of search.
    	\item [R.16] Deny third parties to receive information if the provided information can hurt users' privacy, for this purpose group request under 1000 users involved are rejected.
    	\item [R.14] Collect all the useful information retrieved by Data4Help that are produced by the interested users and send them to request applicant.
    	\end{enumerate}
    	\end{enumerate}
    	
    \item [G.4] \textbf{Provide data in an anonymous way, to protect users' privacy.}
		\begin{enumerate}
    	\item [R.13] Deny third parties to receive information about users that have not accepted second part of privacy policy.
    	\item [R.16] Deny third parties to receive information if the provided information can hurt users' privacy, for this purpose group request under 1000 users involved are rejected.
    	\end{enumerate}	
			
	\end{enumerate}
\item[•]{\Large Data4Help}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [G.5] \textbf{Retrieve user's position and health status.}
	
  	\end{enumerate}

%		\item [G.6] Allow health-interested third parties the access to data detected by AutomatedSOS.
%		\item [G.7] Monitor user's health parameters.
%		\item [G.8] Send an ambulance to users' location whenever certain parameters are below the threshold.
%		\end{enumerate}
	
%\item[•] {\Large Track4Run}	
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item [G.5] Retrieve user's position and health status.
%		\item [G.9] Allow promoters to manage a run.
%		\begin{enumerate}
%		\item [G.9.1] Allow promoters to define a path for the run. 
%		\item [G.9.2] Allow promoters to invite athletes to the run. 
%		\end{enumerate}
