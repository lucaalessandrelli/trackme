    \item [G.2] \textbf{Provide to Third Parties, the users' position and heath status.}
    	\begin{enumerate} 
    	\item [R.1.5] Allow third parties registration to Data4Help service, where they have to specify all their credentials.
    	\item [R.1.6] Allow third parties to perform request on-demand and in real time
    	\end{enumerate}	
		
	\item [G.2.1] \textbf{Provide data on-demand to non-subscribed third parties.}
		\begin{enumerate} 
		\item [R.1.7] For each user registered ,the system has to automatically retrieve and store data with a resolution of 10 minutes.	
		\item [R.1.8] The system has to collect inside his database all the useful information that match the request.
		\item [R.1.9] The system has to send to applicant all the data already collected
    	\end{enumerate}	
    	
    \item [G.2.2] \textbf{Provide data in real-time to subscribed third parties.}
		\begin{enumerate}
    	\item [R.1.10] Allow third parties subscription to interested group in order to receive live data.
    	\item [D.1.11] Real-time requests last 24 hours in order to avoid waste of resources.
    	\item [R.1.12] When a real time request is performed the system has to collect and store specific users' data with a resolution of 1 minute.
    	\item [R.1.13] Provide to subscribed third parties data as soon as they are available by the system.
    	\end{enumerate}
    		
    	
    	
  	
			
		
	%\item [G.3] Allow third parties registered to retrieve information about users with single and group requests.
	%	\begin{enumerate}
