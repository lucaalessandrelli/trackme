\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[•]{\Large Data4Help}
\bigbreak
\noindent
The third parties interested in having location and health status information of individuals can make the request on the Data4Help’s Website. Since the individuals do not need any particular Data4Help’s App for their data retrievement, Data4Help does not offer any other user interface besides its Website. 
On the Website thought, for the third parties it is possible to make both group and individual requests and to view all the data provided to the specific third party. The third parties in order to send a data request must register through the registration function offered by the Website.
\bigbreak
\noindent
The following mockups represent a basic idea of what the Data4Help’s Website will look like in the first release.

\item[•]{\Large AutomatedSOS}
\bigbreak
\noindent
TrackMe offers to AutomatedSOS users an App for smartwatches, with which the users can see their location and health status information. No interface is offered to the third parties since they interact exclusively with Data4Help's Interface.

\item[•]{\Large Track4Run}
\bigbreak
\noindent
Track4Run users can use an App for smartphone and another one for smartwatches. The first one could be used by everyone, while the second one is made only for the athletes. Like for AutomatedS0S, there is not any interface provided for the third parties.

\subsubsection{Hardware and Software Interfaces}
None of the three services-to-be offer any hardware or software interface to the external world. In order to send an ambulance request to the nearest hospital, AutomatedSOS uses a platform provided by the hospital. All the user data needed for the ambulance intervention (such as the location, health status and so on) are sent, for example, by email. For this reason none of the three services under analysis offer any communication interface.
\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
\subsection{Scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[•]{\Large Scenario 1} \\
The company StatisticsDispenser is interested into weekly providing public statistics about people living in London. For this reason the company, which is already registered to Data4Help, need to send a group monitoring request. After logging into the Data4Help website, StatisticsDispenser open the group request section. The website loads a new page where the company can filter groups through some attributes regarding his members like the age, the gender, the city and many more. For the specific purpose StatisticsDispenser chooses only to filter people who live in London and people who's age is between 20 and 60. Then, due to the fact that the company need future data, StatisticsDispenser subscribes to the group. From now on every time new data is available the system sends a notification to StatisticsDispencer. 
\item[•]{\Large Scenario 2} \\
Mark often goes for a run so he decides to download an app to track his progress. The app he installed on his smartphone is a Partner Application with Data4Help. After he registers to this app he's asked if he wants to give his information to the company TrackMe and also if he wants his data to be treated also as individual data. Right after he accepts the policy he's asked to create a Data4Help account or to link an existing one to the application. Mark never created a Data4Help account so he decides to go through the registration process. He fills all the attributes fields required for the sign up and confirm the registration. Data4Help creates the account and saves all the attributes that Mark filled in. Data4Help is now ready to receive Mark's data from the partner application.
\item[•]{\Large Scenario 3} \\
Bob is 77 years old and lately he's having heart problems. Under his son's advice he decided to use the AutomatedSOS application to receive immediate aid in case of need. One month later Bob doesn't feel okay and his heartbeat value goes below the threshold. AutomatedSOS recognizes that Bob is in a critical health state and quickly sends a report to First Aid system containing useful information like his current location and the reason he's in danger. After the First Aid system received the report, it immediately sends an ambulance to Bob's location and then sends an acknowledge message to AutomatedSOS. The application shows a message on Bob's device to let him know that an ambulance is coming for aid.
\item[•]{\Large Scenario 4} \\
Mario promotes run events for a living so in order to simplify the process he goes through everyday he decides to download Track4Run on his smartphone. The famous company AdiDas designate Mario to promote a run that takes place once a year in Milan. Mario log into the app and enter the "Promote a Run" section, inserts and confirms all the information needed. Track4Run creates the run and makes it available to athletes to enroll in.
\item[•]{\Large Scenario 5} \\
Lately Eddie and his friends are bored of what they usually do so they decided to participate to a different activity. More precisely they want to create a run event using Track4Run App and see who's the fastest at running. Unfortunately Eddie got ill the day before the event but he's just too curios of seeing who of his friends is going to win. For this reason as soon as the run starts he logs into Track4Run and enters the "Spectate a Run" section and select the run created with his friends. A few moments later the map appears on the app with all the athletes positions on it letting Eddie see how the run is proceeding in real time.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item[•] Data4Help service is build to perform trend research from users that download specific partner applications. In order to perform this type of monitoring there is a high use of resources, especially in live acquisition when data must be exchanged within 2 minutes. Therefore , in its first release, this application is developed to track 10.000 users simultaneously (included users from AutomateSOS and Track4Run). 
Since third parties are very few in comparison to users, to serve them a less performance is required. 

\item[•] AutomatedSOS is a very expensive application in terms of performance because it must monitor the individuals all the day long guarantying a data collection with an interval of 2 seconds.

\item[•] Track4Run is a variable expensive application because it has to monitor constantly during the run events (even not all day) the athletes which are participating to them.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item[•] Partner applications request the permission to retrieve location and health status to the device, same for AutomateSOS and Track4Run.
\item[•] Data4Help requires that partner applications can use internet connection and users' mobile data to exchange information.
\item[•] AutomatedSOS requires all day internet connection in order to call an ambulance every time is needed.
\item[•] AutomatedSOS requires internet connection during all the duration of the race to the athletes and to the spectator.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item[•] AutomatedSOS application needs to be installed on a smartwatch (smartphone is not enough) in order to acquire location and health status.
\item[•] Track4Run application requires to be installed on a smartphone or a smartwatch in order to acquire location.
\item[•] Smartphones and smartwatches must be iOS or Android platform.
\item[•] The devices must have internet connection (mobile data are mandatory).
\item[•] The devices must have GPS locator.
\item[•] Smartwatches must have Heart Rate monitor, Blood Pressure monitor, Pedometer, Calories Calculator.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
Data4Help service,clearly has some moments with less load (for example at night) but it's important to guarantee a 24/7 service. Some small concessions are possible during the night.
In order to guarantee AutomatedSOS monitoring this service must be available 24/7, in this case also during the night.
Track4Run service has the same consideration of Data4Help.
\subsubsection{Availability}
Considering that the main core of the service are data, a high level of data redundancy in necessary in order to guarantee an optimal degree of availability.
This system is expected to be available 99.99\% of the time. 
\subsubsection{Security}
Providing data in an anonymous way is one of the goals of the system. In order to guarantee users' privacy, the system implements certificated security communication protocol and advanced cryptography techniques.
In any case users can read and agree privacy policy first.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
In order to guarantee maintainability the entire software project is based on Data4Help primitives (like data request, exchange and classification) that must be developed with accuracy and must be certificated. By using or extending fundamental primitives it is possible to construct incremental and interchangeable blocks that can be used to perform all the other services requested.
\subsubsection{Portability}
Data4Help service can be reached by third parties by http requests, this way every browser can perform requests and retrieve users' data.
AutomatedSOS and Track4Run applications are developed as multi-platform technology so either iOS or Android devices can run these two Apps. AutomatedSOS is developed only for Smartwatch.
