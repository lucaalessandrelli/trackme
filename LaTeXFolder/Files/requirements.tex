\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[â€¢]{\Large Data4Help}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [G.1] Locate user's position on demand and in real time / G.2 Retrieve user's health status on demand and track it in live
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item [D.1.1] Users' information collected are coming from installed app on users' smartphone/smartwatch, that are partner of TrackMe.
		\item [D.1.4] Devices used to monitor individuals always work and report 			the correct values.	
		\item [D.1.6] Partner application always report correct values as well.
		\item [R.1.5] The system in order to collect information has to request and receive data from partner applications installed on users' device.
		\item [R.1.1] The system automatically has to collect and store data, for every tracked user, with a resolution of 10 minutes.
    	\item [R.1.2] The system has to update statistic whenever a data is collected.
    	\item [R.1.3] When a real time request is performed the system has to collect and store data, for the specific users, with a resolution of 1 minute.
    	\item [R.1.6] The system has to manage data from different partner applications installed on users' device to optimize data interpolation.
		\item [D.1.3] Individuals must always dress a smartwatch (or a smartphone) that retrieve health parameters and user's positions.    	
		\end{enumerate}		
		
	\item [G.3] Allow third parties registered to retrieve information about users with single and group requests.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item [D.1.7] In order to perform single mode acquisition, third parties has to insert fiscal code of tracked user (aka: nor security number neither fiscal code are visible on the application).
		\item [R.1.7] Allow third parties to request single mode acquisition providing the fiscal code of interested user.	
		\item [D.1.8] In order to perform group mode acquisition, third parties have to select attributes of individuals in which they are inserted.
		\item [R.1.8] Allow third parties to request group mode acquisition providing the users' attributes which is interested in.		
		
		
		\end{enumerate}		
	\end{enumerate}
